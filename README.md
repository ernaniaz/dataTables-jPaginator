This is a jQuery dataTables integration with jPaginator plugin.

Some time ago I started using the great jQuery DataTables plugin to display data with some projects. By the other way, the jQuery jPaginator adds a great paging tool with optional slider for long page list. This is very usefull when we have a long list of pages, because the user uses the slider and get a real dimension of the data set.
So, I thought why not expand jQuery DataTables, which has a very nice API that permits you to make plugins and extend it funcionability, to use jPaginator paging system.
